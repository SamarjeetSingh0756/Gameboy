<h2>🎮 Games Included</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Snake</strong> – Classic arcade-style snake game fully coded from scratch</li>
  <li><strong>Tetris</strong> – A version adapted from an open-source GitHub project (credits below)</li>
</ul>

<h2>⚙️ Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight and fast performance using native C</li>
  <li>Optimized for the ESP32's memory constraints</li>
  <li>Custom-designed hardware interface</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧠 Why C?</h2>

<p>
  Writing the code in <strong>C</strong> ensured maximum control over memory management and execution speed — essential for smooth gameplay on low-resource hardware like ESP32.
</p>

<h2>🙌 Credits</h2>

<p>
  Special thanks to the original Tetris code contributor whose GitHub repo helped inspire and guide part of the implementation.
